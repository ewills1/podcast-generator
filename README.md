# Podcast Generator

The **Podcast Generator** is a robust Python-based tool designed to streamline the creation and distribution of podcasts. Leveraging **Docker**, **GitHub Actions**, and **YAML configuration**, this project automates workflows for generating, packaging, and deploying podcast episodes efficiently.

---

## Features

- **Automated Podcast Generation**: Converts audio files and metadata into a ready-to-publish podcast format.
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**: Automatically tests, builds, and deploys updates.
- **Containerization with Docker**: Simplified deployment and consistent environment using a Dockerfile.
- **Configurable YAML Workflow**: Flexible automation powered by YAML configuration files.
- **Integration with GitHub**: Leverages GitHub repositories and actions for streamlined collaboration and deployment.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core logic for podcast generation.
- **Docker**: For containerized deployment and cross-platform compatibility.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing, building, and deploying the podcast generator.
- **YAML**: Configures workflows and application behavior.

---

## Prerequisites

To run or contribute to this project, ensure you have:

- **Docker** installed ([Get Docker](https://www.docker.com/)).
- A **GitHub account** for integrating workflows.
- **Python 3.8+** installed (optional for local development).

---

## Setup and Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd podcast-generator
```

### 2. Build and Run with Docker
Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t podcast-generator .
```

Run the container:
```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output podcast-generator
```

### 3. Configure Workflows with GitHub Actions
- Edit the `.github/workflows/podcast-generator.yml` file to customize CI/CD pipelines.
- Push changes to trigger automated testing and deployment.

---

## YAML Workflow Example

Hereâ€™s a sample GitHub Actions YAML file:

```yaml
name: Podcast Generator CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: 3.8

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: |
          docker build -t podcast-generator .

      - name: Deploy
        run: |
          # Add deployment steps here
```

## Example Use Case

1. Add raw audio files and metadata to the `input` directory.
2. Run the generator to create podcast-ready files in the `output` directory.
3. Deploy the podcast to your hosting platform using the CI/CD pipeline.

## What I Learned

Completing the **LinkedIn Learning Path: GitHub Professional Certification** enabled me to:

1. Set up and manage **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD.
2. Use **Docker** to containerize applications for scalable and reliable deployment.
3. Write and debug **YAML workflows** to automate repetitive tasks.

## Future Enhancements

- **Web Interface**: Add a user-friendly front-end for podcast creation.
- **Cloud Integration**: Integrate with platforms like AWS or Azure for scalable hosting.
- **Enhanced Metadata Support**: Include features for dynamic metadata generation.
